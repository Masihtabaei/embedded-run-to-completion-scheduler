## General Information

Here you will find a run-to-completion scheduler that I implemented as part of the course "Embedded Operating Systems" at the university.

A simple API was developed for process management, which offers the following methods:
1. create (to create new processes)
2. destroy (for deleting processes)

Process and context switch can be carried out using pure assembler code as well as a combination of C and assembler (controllable by a macro). Project is heavily commented
and documented. You will find the documentation under `documentation/html` (this directory contains an automatically documentation generated by Doxygen).
This project was implemented and tested for an Arm-based processor (Arm Cortex M4). A concurrent chaser light application (with 8 LEDs) was used for illustration and demonstration.
8 processes take care of 8 leds avaialble. There are several modes of operation which you see in the video below.
